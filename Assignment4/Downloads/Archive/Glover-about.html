        <h3>Website purpose</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Our enduring purpose, that guides everything we do, is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style.
                In the not too distant future, we hope to expand our collection to more than just shirts, such as creating different styles of hats, pants, and accessories.
                We have even started talking with some local businesses about renting a building, so that we may have a physical location that people come and shop at. </p>
